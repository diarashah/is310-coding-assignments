# The Social Media Feed Maze
Diara Shah

## Theme
Welcome to the feed.

This maze explores how social media platforms shape attention, visibility,
and identity - not through choice, but through feeds, metrics, and algorithms
you rarely see.

## How to Solve
You are not jus browsing.
You are being routed to different places.

Use the command line to navigate through the maze and follow the clues.
Each directory reflects a different part of the social media ecosystem.

## Helpful Commands
- `ls -a` — reveal what the platform hides
- `cd` — enter a space
- `cat` — read what the system says

## Instructions
1. Start in the `start` directory — this is where every feed begins.
2. Read **every** `.txt` file. Skipping content leads to misdirection.
3. If something feels missing, it probably is. Try `ls -a`.
4. The maze ends in the `exit` directory — but the system never really ends.

Good luck navigating the feed.
