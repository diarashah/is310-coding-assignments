# Assignment 1: Inspecting the Cultural Web

## Website Inspected
HathiTrust Digital Library  
https://www.hathitrust.org/

## Web Technologies Used
Using inspect first and then other normal browser tools, I found that HathiTrust is built using standard web technologies. The site uses HTML to organize its content, CSS to control the ;ayout and appearance, and JavaScript to support the features like search, navigation, etc.. The presence of many `.css` and `.js` files suggests the site operates at a large, production scale.

## File Types Observed
The site includes common web file types such as `.html`, `.css`, and `.js`. Other files, including `.json` and some JavaScript files, that are to support search and background site functions.

## Who Built the Website
HathiTrust is a collaborative project run by academic and research libraries. Information on the site shows that it is governed by member institutions through a Board of Governors and a Program Steering Committee. The University of Michigan hosts and administers the platform, with technical support from other universities. This indicates the site is maintained by a large team rather than just one single individual.

## GitHub Repository
HathiTrust has a public GitHub organization:
